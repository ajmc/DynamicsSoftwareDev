"#1: Establish a shared vision." (pg. 11)

"However the communication transpires, you have to be willing to risk your
relationship with the team (and sometimes even your career or reputation) for
the good of the team. If you aren't willing to take those kinds of risks, what
you have to say won't be encoded with emotional content strong enough to break
through the defensive walls you are confronting." (pg. 19)

"#2: Get their heads in the game." (pg. 20)

"#3: Create a multi-release technology plan.

The extent of your team's trust in the future will stem from their degree of
happiness with their commitment to and involvement in what I call "the
technology plan." The technology plan is the fundamental output of empowered
consensus, the basis of all trust in the future. In the rough democracy
empowered consensus creates, everybody gets a kind of vote on the technology
plan. More important, everybody's input is rigorously sought. The technology
plan is the foundation of all team behavior: ideally, it embodies the best
thinking of all the team members. 

The technology plan is the contract among the team members, the constitution of
the group." (pg. 22)
