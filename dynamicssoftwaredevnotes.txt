"#1: Establish a shared vision." (pg. 11)

"However the communication transpires, you have to be willing to risk your
relationship with the team (and sometimes even your career or reputation) for
the good of the team. If you aren't willing to take those kinds of risks, what
you have to say won't be encoded with emotional content strong enough to break
through the defensive walls you are confronting." (pg. 19)

"#2: Get their heads in the game." (pg. 20)

"#3: Create a multi-release technology plan.

The extent of your team's trust in the future will stem from their degree of
happiness with their commitment to and involvement in what I call "the
technology plan." The technology plan is the fundamental output of empowered
consensus, the basis of all trust in the future. In the rough democracy
empowered consensus creates, everybody gets a kind of vote on the technology
plan. More important, everybody's input is rigorously sought. The technology
plan is the foundation of all team behavior: ideally, it embodies the best
thinking of all the team members. 

The technology plan is the contract among the team members, the constitution of
the group." (pg. 22) 

"Strategic features were centered around fundamental and constraining choices...
Competitive features responded to or perhaps even trumped a feature that their
competition had and they didn't...
Customer satisfaction features were feature they head about all the time that
their customers wanted...
Investment features were those things they decided to do to their technology
even though the benefits wouldn't show up in the next release (or even in the
next few releases)...
Paradigmatic features... were those that changed the way people worked." (pg.
25-26)

"The team members will be conscious of the extent of the work that went into the
plan and aware that new initiatives will have to pass through a similarly
extensive process. An idea therefore has to have considerable merit and
probability of survival before it even gets submitted to the team for
consideration. THis tends to reduce random probability of survival before it
even gets submitted to the team for consideration. This tends to reduce random
proposals and creates a relatively stable environment." (pg. 26)
